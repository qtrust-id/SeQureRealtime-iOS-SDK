### SequreSDKBinary
SequreSDK is the official plugin from Qtrust, used to verify the authenticity of products issued by Qtrust’s clients. This SDK utilizes OpenCV to detect glare in images (which can indicate a forged QR code) and employs a `.tflite` model along with TensorFlowLiteTaskVision during camera sessions for object detection. The SDK also allows users to fully customize the views for each result page and loading process.
